Organization owners can restore deleted repositories that were owned by the organization.About repository restoration
A deleted repository can be restored within 90 days, unless the repository was part of a fork network that is not currently empty. A fork network consists of a parent repository, the repository's forks, and forks of the repository's forks. If your repository was part of a fork network, it cannot be restored unless every other repository in the network is deleted or has been detached from the network. For more information about forks, see "About forks."
If you want to restore a repository that was part of a fork network that is not currently empty, you can contact GitHub Support.
It can take up to an hour after a repository is deleted before that repository is available for restoration.
Restoring a repository will not restore release attachments or team permissions. Issues that are restored will not be labeled.
